# MNIST Digit Classification with DANs in TensorFlow

In this project, we train a discriminative adversarial network (DAN) to classify
MNIST handwritten digit. We experimentally compare different normalization
approaches, activation functions and training objectives.

## Dicriminative Adversarial Networks (DANs)

The discriminative adversarial network (DAN) is proposed by Mirza _et al._ as a
discriminative framework for learning loss functions for semi-supervised
learning [1]. It is based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs) [1] and
the conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the generator
now becomes a predictor that take as input an unlabeled data and predict its
label. The discriminator take as input either a real-data-real-label pair
(__x__, __y__) or a real-data-fake-label pair (__x__, G(__x__)) and aim to tell
the fake ones from the real ones.

Unlike a typical traditional supervised training scenario, where we need to pick
a specific surrogate loss function as the objective of the predictor to learn
the distribution _p_(__y__|__x__), in DANs the discriminator provides the
critics for the predictor. Hence, _the generator is not optimizing any specific
form of surrogate loss function_ for the discriminator is being optimized along
the training process.

## Prerequisites

> __Below we assume the working directory is the repository root.__

### Install dependencies

- Using pipenv (recommended)

  > Make sure `pipenv` is installed. (If not, simply run `pip install pipenv`.)

  ```sh
  # Install the dependencies
  pipenv install
  # Activate the virtual environment
  pipenv shell
  ```

- Using pip

  ```sh
  # Install the dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Prepare training data

```sh
# Download the training data
./scripts/download_data.sh
# Store the training data to shared memory
./scripts/process_data.sh
```

You can also download the MNIST handwritten digit database manually
[here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Scripts

We provide several shell scripts for easy managing the experiments. (See
[here](scripts/README.md) for a detailed documentation.)

### Train a new model

1. Run the following command to set up a new experiment with default settings.

   ```sh
   # Set up a new experiment
   ./scripts/setup_exp.sh "./exp/my_experiment/" "Some notes on my experiment"
   ```

2. Modify the configuration and model parameter files for experimental settings.

3. Train the model by running the following command.

     ```sh
     # Train the model
     ./scripts/run_train.sh "./exp/my_experiment/" "0"
     ```

In the following tables, we report the highest accuracy on the test set that the
model have achieved during the training.
